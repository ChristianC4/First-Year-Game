Welcome to the instructions page!

Here are the controls you will need to start playing:

In order to move your character up and down you will need to use the up and down arrow keys.

The right arrow key fires the "O".

The left arrow key fires the "]".

The spacebar fires the ")".

")" will beat "]".

"]" will beat "O".

"O" will beat ")".

Your moveable character will have a healthbar as well as troop count at the bottom of the screen.

Your troop count will always increase passively over time, and additional troops can be gained by destroying a character inferior to the one you shot. 

If your character's health or your castle's health reaches 0 you will lose.

Press ESC to pause the game at anytime.

Good luck!
